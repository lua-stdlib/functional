# functional's contributors

This file lists major contributors to _functional_.  If you think you
should be listed, please raise a [github][] issue.  Thanks also to all
those who have contributed bug fixes, suggestions and support.

Gary V. Vaughan now maintains _functional_, having rewritten and
reorganized all the original code from [lua-stdlib][], in addition to
adding a lot of new functionality.

Reuben Thomas started the standard libraries project, which included the
original implementation of many of the functions now distributed with
this package.
